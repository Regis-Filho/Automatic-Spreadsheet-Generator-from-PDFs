**Automatic Spreadsheet Generator from PDFs**

### Project Description

This project aims to develop an automated tool that reads data from PDF files and exports it to Excel spreadsheets. By utilizing powerful libraries such as `PyPDF2` and `openpyxl`, the application will enable efficient extraction of structured information from PDF documents, such as tables, lists, and other relevant data, converting them into widely-used spreadsheet formats.

### Project Objectives

1. **Automate PDF Reading**: Implement a system capable of reading and extracting data from PDF files accurately and efficiently.
   
2. **Data Processing**: Manipulate and organize the extracted data to facilitate its export to Excel spreadsheets.
   
3. **Spreadsheet Generation**: Create Excel spreadsheets from the extracted data, preserving the original structure and format of the information.

### Technologies Used

- **Python**: The primary programming language for the project.
- **PyPDF2**: A library for PDF file manipulation.
- **openpyxl**: A library for creating and manipulating Excel files.
- **customtkinter**: A library for developing the graphical user interface (GUI).

### Features

1. **Graphical User Interface (GUI)**: A user-friendly interface developed with `customtkinter` to facilitate interaction with the tool.
   
2. **PDF File Selection**: An option for the user to select the PDF file to be processed.
   
3. **Data Extraction**: Automatic reading and extraction of structured data from the PDF.
   
4. **Conversion to Excel**: Export of the extracted data to an Excel (.xlsx) file.
   
5. **Results Display**: Show the results of the extraction in the interface, allowing the user to review before saving.

### Project Structure

1. **Graphical User Interface**:
   - Main screen with buttons to select the PDF file and start processing.
   - Display of status messages and results.

2. **Data Extraction Module**:
   - Functions for reading PDFs using `PyPDF2`.
   - Processing and organizing the extracted data.

3. **Spreadsheet Generation Module**:
   - Functions for creating and manipulating Excel files with `openpyxl`.

4. **Error Handling**:
   - Exception handling and user-friendly error messages.

### Benefits

- **Efficiency**: Reduces the time needed to manually extract and organize data from PDFs.
- **Accuracy**: Minimizes human errors in data transfer.
- **Flexibility**: Adapts to different types of PDF documents and data structures.

### Target Audience

This project is ideal for professionals dealing with large volumes of data in PDFs and needing to convert them regularly into spreadsheets, such as data analysts, administrators, accountants, and managers.

### Conclusion

The Automatic Spreadsheet Generator from PDFs will provide a practical and efficient solution for extracting and converting data from PDFs to Excel spreadsheets, significantly contributing to productivity and accuracy in information management.
